# Here are some examples how to create a Villager
####################


A Villager with 1 trade looks like this:

####################
# villager 1 trades
####################

"villager 1 trades" {
    I:HowManyTrades=1
    S:trade-1 <
        0001-1-0
        0001-0-0
        0001-1-0
     >
}


Meanings:

The first block initiates the new Villagers cathegory.
The first variable named HowManyTrades gives the amount of trades.
The next variable is named trade-<number of the trade> and is cut into 3 rows with 3 columns.
 - The first column is the items ID.
 - The second column is the amount used in the trade.
 - The last is the damage value.

The first two rows are the cost the last row is the item you purchase.
Set the second items amount 0 to have no second trade item.
NEVER set a item ID 0000!!!
